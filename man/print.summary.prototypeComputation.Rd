\title{Print Summary Statistics for Prototype Computation Objects}
\usage{
\method{print}{summary.prototypeComputation}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{summary.prototypeComputation} object created by
\code{\link{summary.prototypeComputation}}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to print methods (currently unused).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the input object \code{x} unchanged. The function
  is called primarily for its side effect of printing formatted output.
}
\description{
Displays a formatted summary of prototype-based classification results,
showing both marginal and conditional probability distributions for
categories and features. This method provides a comprehensive overview
of how the prototype model distributes probability mass across categories
and features.
}
\details{
The printed output is organized into two main sections:

\strong{Categories Section:}
\itemize{
  \item \emph{Marginals}: Overall probability of assignment to each category
    across all observations, computed as \code{colMeans(object$probabilities)}
  \item \emph{Conditionals}: Two sub-lists showing P(C|X) - the probability
    of each category given feature values:
    \itemize{
      \item \code{Xk=0}: Category probabilities when each feature equals 0
      \item \code{Xk=1}: Category probabilities when each feature equals 1
    }
}

\strong{Features Section:}
\itemize{
  \item \emph{Marginals}: Overall probability that each feature equals 1
    across all observations, computed as \code{colMeans(object$data)}
  \item \emph{Conditionals}: The probability that each feature equals 1
    given membership in each category, P(X|C).
}

All probability values are rounded to 3 decimal places for readability.
