\title{Extract theoretical conditional probabilities for bivariate case}
\usage{
bivariateCondProb(parameters, kstar)
}
\arguments{
\item{parameters}{A list containing marginal probabilities and correlation matrix,
as returned by \code{\link{get_params}}.}

\item{kstar}{Integer. The index of the variable receiving all attention
(must be between 1 and the number of variables)}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector of conditional probabilities P(X_j = 1 | X_k* = 1)
  for all variables j, where the variable at position \code{kstar} will have
  probability 1 (since X_k* = 1 is the conditioning event)
}
\description{
Computes the theoretical conditional probabilities P(X_j = 1 | C = c1)
for all variables j when attention is focused entirely on variable k*.
In this case, we have that P(X_j = 1 | C = c1) = P(X_j = 1 | X_k* = 1)
This uses the bivariate normal distribution to compute exact conditional
probabilities based on the correlation structure.
