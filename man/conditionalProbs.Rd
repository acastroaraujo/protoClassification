\title{Calculate Conditional Probabilities from Prototype Model}
\usage{
conditionalProbs(x, type = c("features", "categories"), s = 500)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{prototypeComputation} object created by \code{\link{compute}}.}

\item{type}{Character string specifying the type of conditional probabilities:
\describe{
  \item{\code{"features"}}{Returns P(X|C) - probability of features given categories}
  \item{\code{"categories"}}{Returns P(C|X) - probability of categories given feature values}
}}

\item{s}{Integer. Number of posterior draws used for sampling-based estimation.
Default is 500. Results are averaged across all draws to provide point estimates.}
}
\value{
The return structure depends on the \code{type} parameter:

  For \code{type = "features"}:
  A data frame with categories as rows and features as columns, where each cell
  contains P(X_k = 1 | C_j). To get P(X_k = 0 | C_j) you can calculate 1 - "data frame".

  For \code{type = "categories"}:
  A list with two elements:
  \describe{
    \item{\code{Xk=0}}{Matrix of P(C_j | X_k = 0) for each feature k and category j}
    \item{\code{Xk=1}}{Matrix of P(C_j | X_k = 1) for each feature k and category j}
  }
}
\description{
Computes point estimates of conditional probabilities from a prototype
computation, either P(X|C) (feature probabilities given categories) or
P(C|X) (category probabilities given feature values). This function
provides the expected values of the conditional probability distributions.
}
\details{
This function provides point estimates by taking the mean of the sampling
distributions generated by \code{\link{conditionalProbsSample}}. The conditional
probabilities represent:

\itemize{
  \item \strong{P(X|C)}: Given that an observation belongs to category C,
    what is the probability that feature X has value 1?
  \item \strong{P(C|X)}: Given that feature X has a specific value (0 or 1),
    what is the probability that the observation belongs to category C?
