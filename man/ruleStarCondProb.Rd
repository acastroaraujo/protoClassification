\title{Extract theoretical conditional probabilities for the rule-based case
with exclusive attention on one feature.}
\usage{
ruleStarCondProb(pxk, pxkstar, corr)
}
\arguments{
\item{pxk}{Numeric. Marginal probability P(X_k = 1) for variable k.}

\item{pxkstar}{Numeric. Marginal probability P(X_k* = 1) for the attention variable k*.}

\item{corr}{Numeric. Correlation between variables Xk and Xk*.}
}
\value{
Numeric value representing the conditional probability P(X_k = 1 | X_k* = 1)
}
\description{
Computes the theoretical conditional probabilities P(X_j = 1 | C = c1)
for all variables j when attention is focused entirely on variable k*.
In this case, we have that P(X_j = 1 | C = c1) = P(X_j = 1 | X_k* = 1)
This uses the bivariate normal distribution to compute exact conditional
probabilities based on the correlation structure.
}
\details{
The function computes the joint probability P(X_k = 1, X_k* = 1) using
  the bivariate normal distribution with the given correlation structure, then
  divides by P(X_k* = 1) to obtain the conditional probability.
}
\examples{
# Compute conditional probability for positively correlated variables
ruleStarCondProb(pxk = 0.3, pxkstar = 0.4, corr = 0.5)

# Compare with negatively correlated variables
ruleStarCondProb(pxk = 0.3, pxkstar = 0.4, corr = -0.5)
