\title{Compute the log-density of the LKJ distribution for correlation matrices}
\source{
These functions come from Richard McElreath's \href{https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking/blob/master/R/distributions.r}{rethinking} package
and, judging by the source code, it seems that he got them from Ben Goodrich.
}
\usage{
dlkjcorr(x, eta = 1, log = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A symmetric positive definite matrix with 1s on the diagonal
(i.e., a correlation matrix)}

\item{eta}{Numeric. Shape parameter controlling the concentration around the
identity matrix. Must be positive. When eta = 1, the distribution is uniform
over correlation matrices. As eta increases, more mass is placed on matrices
closer to the identity matrix}

\item{log}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), returns the log-density.
If \code{FALSE}, returns the density on the original scale}
}
\value{
Numeric value representing the (log) density of the correlation matrix
  under the LKJ distribution with the specified eta parameter
}
\description{
Computes the (log) probability density of a correlation matrix under the
LKJ (Lewandowski-Kurowicka-Joe) distribution. The LKJ distribution is
parameterized by a shape parameter eta that controls the concentration
around the identity matrix.
}
\details{
The LKJ density is proportional to det(R)^(eta-1), where R is the
  correlation matrix. This function computes this density (or log-density).
  Note that this is the unnormalized density - the normalizing constant
  is not included.
